## Food Distribution Thursday, February 25, 2021 from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. at University Health Services


Hello,

You have asked us, for some of you, since December 2020, to benefit from food aid from the University of Orleans.

Therefore, we suggest that you come with your student card and a copy of your identity card tomorrow, Thursday 25 February 2021, between 10am and 12pm at the University Health Service of Orléans - 9 rue de Tours, 45100 Orléans.
Please note: only those students who have been invited by this email will be received on this day.

Finally, as part of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, we respect the barrier gestures and ask you to come with a mask. We may ask you to wait outside the department for a few minutes to avoid the flow in the department.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely
